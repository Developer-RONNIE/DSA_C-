# 📃 TOPICS 



### 1. Flow Chart 📉
- Flowcharts show the steps of a program in a simple way, making it easier to understand how it works.

- They help find mistakes in the program by showing how each step connects, making it easier to fix errors.

- Flowcharts make it easier for developers to explain how a program works to others, even if they aren't familiar with programming.

- They help solve problems by showing a clear picture of the program’s flow and making it easier to find where things go wrong.

- Flowcharts are useful for keeping a clear record of how a program works, which helps when making changes later.
