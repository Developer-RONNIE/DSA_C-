# FUNCTIONS âš“

- A function is a set of statements that takes input, does some specific computation, and produces output. 
- The idea is to put some commonly or repeatedly done tasks together to make a function so that instead of writing the same code again and again for different inputs, we can call this function.

- *Parameters* : are the placeholders in a function's definition.
- *Arguments* : are the actual values passed to a function when it's called.
- *Literals*:  are values that are written directly in the code, such as numbers, strings, and booleans. They cannot be changed once they are assigned.


### Function Memory 
- Generally in C++ we store data in either stack / heap memory.
- Static data is stored in stack whereas, dynamic data is stored in heap memory. 
- Hence, Functions are stored in Stack.
