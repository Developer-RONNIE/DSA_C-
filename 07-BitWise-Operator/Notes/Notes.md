# Bitwise Operators

Bitwise operators in C++ perform operations on integer data at the individual bit-level. 
These operations include testing, setting, or shifting the actual bits. 
Here’s a breakdown of the 6 bitwise operators in C++:

1. Bitwise AND (&): Performs a logical AND operation on each corresponding bit of the two operands. 
If both bits are 1, the result is 1; otherwise, it’s 0.
Example: a & b (where a and b are integers)

2. Bitwise OR (|): Performs a logical OR operation on each corresponding bit of the two operands. 
If either bit is 1, the result is 1; otherwise, it’s 0.
Example: a | b

3. Bitwise XOR (^): Performs a logical XOR (exclusive OR) operation on each corresponding bit of the two operands. 
If the bits are different, the result is 1; otherwise, it’s 0.
Example: a ^ b

4. Bitwise NOT (~): Inverts all the bits of the operand. 0 becomes 1, and 1 becomes 0.
Example: ~a

5. Left Shift (<<): Shifts the bits of the operand to the left by a specified number of positions. 
The vacated positions are filled with zeros.
Example: a << 2

6. Right Shift (>>): Shifts the bits of the operand to the right by a specified number of positions. 
The filled positions are zeros for signed integers and zeros or copies of the sign bit for unsigned integers.
Example: a >> 2

7. SOLVE : 
- 6 & 10 
- 6 | 10 
- 6 ^ 10 
- 10 << 2
- 10 >> 1
