# BINARY NUMBER SYSTEM

Binary Number System uses two digits, 0 and 1, and is the foundation for all modern computing. The word binary is derived from the word “bi” which means two. But what makes it so essential, and how does it work? In this article, we will dive deep into binary numbers, binary decimal number conversion and vice versa, 1’s and 2’s complement, and how they are used in computer systems.

There are generally various types of number systems and among them the four major ones are,

- Binary Number System (Number system with Base 2)
- Octal Number System (Number system with Base 8)
- Decimal Number System (Number system with Base 10)
- Hexadecimal Number System (Number system with Base 16)

## Binary Number Table

| Decimal Number | Binary Number | Decimal Number | Binary Number |
|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| 1 | 001 | 11 | 1011 |
| 2 | 010 | 12 | 1100 |
| 3 | 011 | 13 | 1101 |
| 4 | 100 | 14 | 1110 |
| 5 | 101 | 15 | 1111 |
| 6 | 110 | 16 | 10000 |
| 7 | 111 | 17 | 10001 |
| 8 | 1000 | 18 | 10010 |
| 9 | 1001 | 19 | 10011 |
| 10 | 1010 | 20 | 10100 |

## Two's Compliment 
There are three different ways to represent signed integer . 
a: Signed bit
b: [1’s Complement](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ones-complement/?ref=ml_lbp)
c: [2’s Complement](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/twos-complement/)
