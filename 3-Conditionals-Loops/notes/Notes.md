# CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS 

### Over View : 
- Conditional statements are fundamental structures in programming.
- They allow programs to make decisions based on certain conditions are true or false.
- These statements control the flow of execution depending on logical conditions.
- They enable the program to behave differently in various situations.
- Common examples include if, else, else if, and switch statements.
- Conditional statements are used to execute specific code when a condition is true, and alternative code when false.
- They are essential for implementing logic that responds to different inputs or scenarios dynamically.

### Types Of Conditional Statements
1. if Statement - Executes a block of code if a specified condition is true.
2. if-else Statement - Executes one block of code if a condition is true and another if the condition is false.
3. else if Statement - Checks multiple conditions and executes the block of code corresponding to the first true condition.
4. switch Statement - Evaluates an expression and executes a corresponding block of code based on matching values.
5. Ternary Operator - A shorthand version of the if-else statement that assigns values based on a condition in a single line. 


### Why Use Conditional Statements?
To perform different actions based on varying conditions.
To control the logical flow of programs.
To implement decision-making capabilities in code.
