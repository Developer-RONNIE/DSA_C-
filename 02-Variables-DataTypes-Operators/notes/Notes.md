### Boiler Plate Code in C++ 
- Boilerplate or a code-snippet are solution provided by IDEs like VS Code, where a repetitive code can be called within a program by typing prefix names.

### Type Conversion & Type Casting
- Type Conversion: *Automatic process of changing data type of a value, e.g., int to float.*
- Type Casting: *Manual process of changing data type of a value, e.g., (float)int.*
